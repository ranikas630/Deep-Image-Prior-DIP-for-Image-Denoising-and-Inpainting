Deep Image Prior (DIP) for Image Denoising and Inpainting

This project implements the Deep Image Prior (DIP) technique using TensorFlow and Keras, focusing on tasks like denoising and inpainting. DIP is unique as it utilizes neural networks to enhance images without relying on labeled data. Key functionalities include adding noise to images for denoising experiments and creating masks for inpainting tasks. The implementation includes two main models: DIP and Deep Decoder, each tailored for specific image processing tasks.

Why Use DIP?

DIP offers a data-driven approach to image enhancement, leveraging the inherent structure of neural networks to improve image quality. It's particularly useful in scenarios where obtaining large amounts of labeled data is impractical or expensive.

Optimal Performance Setup

For best results, it's recommended to run this project on Google Colab's TPU v2 or any GPU-enabled environment. These setups accelerate the training process, especially beneficial when dealing with complex neural network models and large image datasets.

Conclusion

By showcasing this project on GitHub, it aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of DIP in practical image processing applications. Users can explore, experiment, and utilize these techniques to enhance their own images or integrate them into larger machine learning pipelines.

This expanded version provides a clearer context for potential users or collaborators, emphasizing the benefits of DIP and the recommended setup for optimal performance.
